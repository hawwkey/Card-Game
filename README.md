# Card Game #
## Assignment ##
HiLo is a card game where a card is dealt and the player has to guess whether the next card that is dealt will be higher or lower than the first card. In the application a card is first dealt on the left hand side. In this case, the card is the King of Clubs. Then, a guess as to whether the next card dealt will be higher or lower is indicated, using the radio buttons in the centre. On clicking the 'Deal Second Card' button, another card is dealt on the right hand side. If the card dealt is in accordance with the guess of the user, then the user wins. Five consecutive, correct guesses constitute an overall game win. A new game is begun using the menu by selecting the 'New Game' item. Note that for the purpose of comparing cards, only the face of the card matters. The suit, i.e, whether Hearts, Spades, Clubs, etc., is unimportant. A
second card of equal face value is considered a lose for the purposes of this game.
